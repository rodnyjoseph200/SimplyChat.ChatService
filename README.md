# SimplyChat
SimplyChat offers a unique alternative to traditional messaging platforms. While many conventional messaging services require users to create and maintain profiles or expose personal phone numbers (as seen with platforms like WhatsApp), SimplyChat is designed with user ease of use in mind. This solution is especially beneficial for users who may be overseas or prefer not to rely on traditional social media platforms and apps.

# SimplyChat.ChatService (currently in development)

The SimplyChat.ChatService is a backend microservice to the SimplyChat messaging application.
